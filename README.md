Just Duet is a collaborative effort by Clara Beyer, Brian Tenggren, and Eric Rho. 
The goal was to make a simple dating app for our WDI Class project. Our app 
allows users to sing in with their spotify accounts and be ranked with matches in their
area by the songs, artists, and genres they have in common. As well as gender and 
gender they are looking for. 

Features
=========
Our App has a favoriting system between users. Two users who have favorited each other
will be allowed to see each other on their match pages and send messages. 

Users can see other users profiles from their area
They can change their profile information 
On each Login it will refresh their tracks they may have added on spotify

It was made using Haml, Rails 4, JQuery, and CSS/SCSS.

Install
=========
To install You need to have a spotify api developers key and a spotify secret.
You need to have a amazon web services bucket, secret access key, and api key.
You will also need to register your application with Spotify and set an OAuth redirect.

We included a variety of gems. Be sure to bundle!

About
=========
This App was desgined, developed, and styled in one week for our web development program
at General Assembly, Boston. We focused on working as a team on programming and 
developing together.
